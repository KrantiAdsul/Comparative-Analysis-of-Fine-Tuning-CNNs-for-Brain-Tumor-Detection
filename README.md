While running any of the below files please change the dataset folder paths according to the paths required by your local PC

1. VGG16_with_pretrained_not_true - Used to create Baseline of VGG16 model without using pretrained weights
2. VGG16_with_pretrained_true - Used to create Baseline of VGG16 model using pretrained weights
3. ResNet50_base_and_finetune_with_pretrained_not_true - Used to create ResNet50 Base and fine tuning the network without using pretrained model weights
4. ResNet50_base_and_fine_tune_with_pretrained_true - Used to create ResNet50 Base and fine tuning the network using pretrained model weights
5. ResNet50_base_weighted_weights 

All these Jupyter Notebooks are annotated at appropriate places
